# JETSON setup

Quick (actually very long) remainder how to setup a jetson nano

## Hardware

What you actually need as material

+ [Jetson Nano Developer Kit](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit)

+ [IntelÂ® Dual Band Wireless-AC 8265](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/94150/intel-dual-band-wireless-ac-8265.html)

+ [5V 4A (4000mA) switching power supply ](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466)(Any powersuply will do as is 5V, 4A, 5.5mm OD and 2.1mm ID)

+ [Micro SD](https://www.sandisk.com/home/memory-cards/microsd-cards/extreme-microsd) (At least 32G)

+ Standard Computer Jumper Caps]

+ A micro USB to cable

## Preparing the kit

You only need to put the kit together if you want you can follow the tutorials

+ [For the WIFI](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2019/04/08/jetson-nano-intel-wifi-and-bluetooth/)

+ [For use the barrel adapter](https://www.jetsonhacks.com/2019/04/10/jetson-nano-use-more-power/)

## Image and connection to the wifi

For the image and the WIFI we are going to use the [jetcard](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetcard) image and almost the same procedure that the [jetracer software](https://github.com/NVIDIA-AI-IOT/jetracer/blob/master/docs/software_setup.md) 

### Step 1 - Flash micro SD card

1. Download the JetCard SD card image [jetcard_v0p0p0.img](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wXD1CwtxiH5Mz4uSmIZ76fd78zDQltW_) onto a Windows, Linux or Mac *desktop machine*
    
    > You can check it against this [md5sum](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1356ZBrYUWaTgbV50UMB1uCfWrNcd6PEF)

2. Insert a 32GB+ SD card into the desktop machine
3. Using [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) select ``jetcard_v0p0p0.img`` and flash it onto the SD card
4. Remove the SD card from the desktop machine

> Please note, the password for the pre-built SD card is ``jetson``

### Step 2 - Power on and connect over USB

1. Insert the configured SD card into the Jetson Nano module

2. Power on by plugging the powersuply to the jetson

3. Connect your Windows, Linux, or Mac machine to the Jetson Nano via micro USB

4. On your Windows, Linux, or Mac machine, open a browser and navigate to ``192.168.55.1:8888``
5. Sign in using the default password ``jetson``

### Step 3 - Connect the Jetson to WiFi

1. Open a terminal in Jupyter Lab by clicking ``File`` -> ``New`` -> ``Terminal``

2. In the terminal, type the following command to list available WiFi networks, and find the ``ssid_name`` of your network.

    ```bash
    sudo nmcli device wifi list
    ```
3. Connect to  the selected WiFi network

    >  It should be on the same network that you will be webprogramming from

    ```bash
    sudo nmcli device wifi connect <ssid_name> password <password>
    ```
4. Note down the WiFi IP returned by the following command.  We'll call this ``jetson_ip_address``
    
    ```bash
    ip route get 1.2.3.4 | awk '{print $7}'
    ```
5. Turn off the power safe mode to avoid losing the wifi connection

    ```bash
    sudo iw dev wlan0 set power_save off
    ```
### Step 4 - Connect to the Jetson over WiFi in ssh 

1. Unplug the micro USB cable from the Jetson Nano

2. Close the previous Jupyter Lab browser tab

3. Open a new terminal and connect to the jetson in ssh wirh the following command and navigate to 

    ```bash
    ssh jetson@<jetson_ip_address>
    ```
4. Sign in with the password ``jetson``
